            <p>One thing I have always been interested in is content creation. One year ago, I decided to post on Tiktok.</p>
            <p>Creating videos is something that I have been doing for years. Learning the different effects from music videos first piqued my interest.</p>
            <p>Eventually, I decided to start my own page. My content is mainly sports videos using some of my favorite songs ever.</p>

            <p>Music has had a huge impact on my life. It's what also helped inspire me to post on Tiktok.</p>
            <p>About two years ago, videos would come across my page with people showing off vinyls they recently purchased.</p>
            <p>I took interest in the videos as it showed the different music tastes that everyone has. That's when I started collecting myself.</p>
            <p>I own roughly about 40 different vinyl records, and I spin one almost every day.</p>
